I guided the user through multiple questions, validated the data in real time, and allowed them to confirm or re-enter the information if necessary. This approach ensures that the user is actively involved in verifying their inputs, which helps reduce errors. I used a dictionary structure to consolidate the validated entries because it provides clarity and simplicity when accessing the data during subsequent steps, such as BMI calculation and risk assessment. The step-by-step confirmation also ensures the accuracy of the data before it is processed and stored.\n",

Each piece of information provided by the user, such as age, gender, and health status, is stored with a descriptive key, making the data more readable and easier to retrieve for any subsequent processing or analysis.

For example, if someone is underweight, does not smoke or drink alcohol, and is inactive, their risk is medium; if they smoke, the risk is always high, regardless of other conditions. Finally, the function returns the corresponding risk level and updates the user's data in a CSV file."
